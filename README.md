# personalweb
Full-stack web developer with a background as a musician and instructor. I am passionate about taking on new hands-on challenges where I can collaborate and learn with others. I realized that I could combine my love for logic and composing in music and apply this to coding. As a hard-worker who dreams big, I am really looking forward to joining a diverse and supportive company where Junior developers are welcomed.
Full-stack Development:
- Ruby and Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript
- SQLite
- HTML & CSS
- React
- Redux
- Object-Oriented Programming
